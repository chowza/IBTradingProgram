This is an upload of the files needed to build the IB Trading algorithm I created.

The program works by scheduling 1 trade daily for each contract that it currently holds a position in.

The main function is in the IBTradeGui.java which is a swing gui. 

When the program is initially run, it starts a scheduler every weekday, so that trades can be scheduled at the close of markets.
The close of markets depends on which contract is traded because futures contracts close at separate times. 

Thus the program submits a trade when markets are closed, which results in the trade going through when markets open again.

A separate thread is created in connectionStatus.java which ensures that the program is connected to Interactive Brokers by indicating in the GUI with a green or red box.

When scheduling a trade, the program first downloads the historical price data into PostgreSQL and does a simple calculation of whether to hold the position or reverse it.

The program takes advantage of the IB APIs to request historical price data.
