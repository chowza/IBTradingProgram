This is an upload of the files needed to build an IB trading program I created.

Interactive Brokers has an API which allows you to write algos to trade without human intervention.

This program works by using the API to request historical price data and making a trade based on that data.

Once markets are closed for the day, this program requests that day's data, and adds it to a PSQL database. 

An algorithm decides whether the current position should be held or reversed.

Then a trade is submitted if the position needs to be reversed, and nothing is done if the position is held.

The above jobs are scheduled with a scheduler.

Thus the program makes a decision on whether the position is profitable every day.

The main function can be found in the class IBTradeGui in the folder IBConnect. 

This is swing GUI that when opened, you choose which contracts to trade and you click the start trading button to schedule the trades.
